<p> Only select the following stats if you're a more advanced user: LOB, GB, HR_FB, BABIP, FIP, xFIP, WAR.</p>

<p> It is advised that you select at least 3 statistics to display as you will likely need at least that many to make any 'real' assessments.
  The more stats you select, the more likely it is that you could become overwhelmed. Only select the stats that are important to you!
</p>

<p>
  <strong>WARNING: </strong> An error will be raised if you select less than 3.
